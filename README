# WEBGL Image Node Editor
This is a personal project to implement a simple node editor inspired by Blender's node editors. 

The main design idea is to create a self-contained Typescript framework-agnostic class that can be imported into a web app and used with minimal configuration.

This project uses Typescript and SCSS.
